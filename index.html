        <h2 class="title">welcome to my website</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Lou Blumberg. I'm an artist, educator, and facilitator living in Portland, OR, unceded <a href="https://native-land.ca/">Cowlitz, Clackamas, and Multnomah</a> land.
            I think a lot about personal and community safety, vulnerability and intimacy, and how to live a good life in hopeless times. I'm also a trained conflict mediator (you can <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250218660423147">hire me to mediate your next conflict!</a>).</p>

            <p>i made this website! anyone can make and host a free website on github. I used a lot of w3schools, some chat gpt (though now I'm hoping to use less extractive and tech-oligarch-supporting systems), and help from others. I hope to improve it but I also might not. with this website I'm asking what's possible when we proudly share our works in progress. or it's just a cop out! &#x1F937; </p>
